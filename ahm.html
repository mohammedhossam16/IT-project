      In the world of programming, there are always new technologies and tools that help developers, but few of them
      remain and leave an impact. But there are techniques that, at first glance, are clear that they are here to stay,
      and filters undoubtedly belong to this list...

          The latest global technology ..<br>

          It is an SDK from Google dedicated to programming smart phone applications operating on the Android system,
          IOS and Fuchsia (a new operating system from Google) and also began to develop to be able to develop the web,
          as it focuses on the experience of the user and the developer at the same time, and this is because it
          provides a comprehensive framework The Dart language is dedicated to drawing destinations with high quality
          and original applications with excellent performance, and at the same time it gives the developer the tools
          that make him build complete applications in the least time.

          <dt>What does FLUTTER offer?</dt>
          <dd>
            The most important thing that the Flutter framework has to offer the mobile app makers community
            is that it can create Android and iOS apps at the same time with similar source code, and it also uses
            a compiled programming language called Dart, which is compiled 'ahead of time' AOT. ) to native code for
            both
            iOS and Android. Also, the framework is not like its predecessors that rely on javascript as a bridge
            between
            the browser and the operating system, in addition to facilitating modular writing of codes and creating
            professional
            interfaces with the least possible and readable code. A few days ago, Google released the first stable
            version of
            Flutter, which bore the name Flutter 1.0, which will be a cross-platform for developing applications for all
            systems
            and devices as well, to officially start the era of Flutter.

          <dt>Interfaces and system interfaces ?</dt>
          <dd>

            One of the advantages of Flutter, which made it easier to develop mobile applications
            , is its reliance on the widgets system. Flutter is even easier. The Widgets system in
            the Flutter framework made it easy to create new components, and the power of the Dart
            language also contributed to it being an object-oriented language in this matter, so
            that it is possible to take a main widget and add new properties of effects and animations
            to it in a simple and uncomplicated way. This made it possible to create new components
            within the framework and to include Material Design in components running on Android and Cupertino on IOS.

          <dt>FLUTTER against the rest of the competitors in the market?</dt>
          <dd>

            Of course, the market for programming smart phone applications is very large, and in the recent period
            solutions appeared that enable us to make applications for both the popular Android and IOS systems in
            addition to the web, the desktop and embedded devices at the same time, and these solutions differ
            technically,
            and in this table I will explain to you the important differences Among the top four competitors now in the
            smartphone
            app development market in one language (the comparison will not include the native tools i.e. Java and
            Kotlin for
            Android and Swift and Object-C for IOS).

          <dt>What's new in FLUTTER ?</dt>
          <dd>

            There are several new ideas that FLUTTER came up with. As the philosophy of the Flatter team is the
            possibility of drawing each pixel
            on the screen freely and not being linked to the system, i.e. just like games, but the factor that made
            Flatter reach what it has
            reached now is direct support from another team in Google, which is the Material Design team, because
            Flatter provides all the components
            Material Design, in its latest version, even before Android got it, and this was announced at the Google IO
            conference this year
            . And one of the things in which there is a big difference is the method of FLUTTER in drawing interfaces
            because FLUTTER use
            the programming language Dart in everything for writing and design as well.

          <dt> Are there large companies using FLUTTER now?</dt>
          <dd>
            Yes, including Google, of course, and Google has published a page containing all the famous applications
            that were made using FLUTTER,
            and this is the link to the page. This is also an article published this week about the largest development
            companies that started using filters.

            Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography<br> to secure and verify transactions
            and to control<br> the creation of new units. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized,<br> meaning they are not
            controlled by a central authority such as a bank or government. Instead, <br>they use a distributed ledger
            technology called blockchain,<br> which allows for secure and transparent record-keeping.

              The majority of cryptocurrencies function without the backing of a central bank or government.<br> Instead
              of relying on government guarantees, decentralized technology called blockchain underpins the operation of
              cryptocurrencies.
              Cryptocurrencies do not exist as a stack of notes or coins. <BR>Instead, they live only on the internet.
              <br>Consider them virtual tokens, the value of which is decided by market forces created by those seeking
              to purchase or sell them.
              Cryptocurrency is formed through a process known as mining,<BR>which entails employing computer processing
              power to solve complex mathematical problems to earn coins.<br> Users can also purchase the currencies
              from brokers, which they can then store and spend using encrypted wallets.

            cryptocurrency transaction is usually a rapid and straightforward process.<BR>
            Bitcoin, for example, can be exchanged between digital wallets using only a <BR>
            smartphone or computer. Public and private keys and various incentive schemes <BR>
            such as proof-of-work and proof-of-stake are used to safeguard these transfers.<BR>
            Payments in cryptocurrencies are growing more popular among large corporations <BR>
            and in industries such as fashion and pharmaceuticals.

            Every cryptocurrency transaction is recorded in a public ledger<BR>
            known as the blockchain, which is the technology that makes it <BR>
            possible for it to exist. This allows people to follow the history <BR>
            of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to prevent them from spending coins<BR>
            they don't own, copying transactions, or undoing them. Because<BR>
            blockchain intends to eliminate intermediaries such as banks and<BR>
            internet marketplaces, there are no transaction costs.</H4>

  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>
      Bitcoin is the first and most valuable cryptocurrency.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>
      Ethereum is commonly used to carry out financial transactions more complex than those supported by Bitcoin.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>
      Cardano is a competitor to Ethereum led by one of its co-founders.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>
      Litecoin is an adaptation of Bitcoin intended to make payments easier
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>
      Solana is another competitor to Ethereum that emphasizes speed and cost-effectiveness.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>
      Dogecoin began as a joke but has grown to be among the most valuable cryptocurrencies.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="ls">Thoughtfully selecting your cryptocurrency, however, is no guarantee of success in such a volatile
    space. Sometimes, an issue in the deeply interconnected crypto industry can spill out and have broad implications on
    asset values.

    For instance, in November of 2023 the market took a major hit as the cryptocurrency exchange FTX struggled to deal
    with liquidity issues amid a spike in withdrawals. As the fallout spread, cryptocurrencies both large and small saw
    their values plummet.</p>

        <p>
            Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing<br>
            HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact<br>
            with them directly.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h2 style="color: #127369;">What Skills Do You Need to Become a Front End Developer?</h2> <br>
        The three main languages you need to know well are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
        From there you can focus on frameworks, libraries, and other useful tools.
        </p>


        <p>
        <h3 style="color: #127369;">Hyper Text Markup Language</h3><br>
        <br>
        HyperText Markup Language <b>(HTML)</b> is the backbone of any website development process,<br>
        without which a web page does not exist.Hypertext means that text has links, termed hyperlinks,<br>
        embedded in it. <br>
        <br>
        When a user clicks on a word or a phrase that has a hyperlink, it will bring another web-page.<br>
        A markup language indicates text can be turned into images, tables, links, and other representations.<br>
        It is the HTML code that provides an overall framework of how the site will look.<br>
        HTML was developed by<b> Tim Berners-Lee</b>.<br>
        <br>
        The latest version of HTML is called <b>HTML5</b> and was published on October 28, 2014 by the<b>W3C</b>
        recommendation.<br>
        This version contains new and efficient ways of handling elements such as video and audio files.

        <p>
        <h3 style="color: #127369;">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h3><br>
        Cascading Style Sheets <b>(CSS)</b> controls the presentation aspect of the site and allows your site to have
        its own unique look.<br>
        It does this by maintaining style sheets that sit on top of other style rules and are triggered based on other
        inputs,<br>
        such as device screen size and resolution. The <b>CSS</b> can be added externally, internally, or embedded in
        the<b> HTML</b> tags.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h3 style="color: #127369;">JavaScript</h3><br>
        JavaScript is an event-based imperative programming language (as opposed to<b> HTML's</b> declarative language
        model) <br>
        that is used to transform a static<b> HTML</b> page into a dynamic interface.<br>
        JavaScript code can use the Document Object Model <b>(DOM)</b>, provided by the <b>HTML</b> standard,<br>
        to manipulate a web page in response to events, like user input.<br>
        <br>
        Using a technique called AJAX, JavaScript code can also actively retrieve content from the web<br>
        (independent of the original HTML page retrieval), and also react to server-side events as well,<br>
        adding a truly dynamic nature to the web page experience.
        </p>

        <p>
        <h3 style="color: #127369;">WebAssembly</h3><br>
        WebAssembly, supported by all the major browsers (i.e. from the major vendors Google, Apple, Mozilla and
        Microsoft),<br>
        is the only alternative to JavaScript for running code in web browsers (without the help of plug-ins, such as
        <b>Flash</b>,<br>
        <b>Java</b> or <b>Silverlight</b>; all being discontinued, as browsers are dropping plug-in support). Prior to
        its adoption,<br>
        there was asm.js (a subset of JavaScript; and thus strictly works in all browsers), that's also used as a
        compiler<br>
        target with efficient support in browsers such as Internet Explorer 11; and for such browsers that do not
        support WebAssembly directly,<br>
        it can be compiled to asm.js and those browsers supported that way. <br>
        <br>
        Generally speaking programmers do not program in WebAssembly (or asm.js) directly,<br>
        but use languages such as Rust, <b>C</b> or <b>C++</b> or in theory any language, that compile to it.
